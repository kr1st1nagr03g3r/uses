# Uses 
### My Preferred Tools / Setup / Extensions For Front-End Web Development

## Hardware ##
üíª I prefer to use Macbook Pros, despite being forced to use Windows 10 by my employer. üòù  

ü™õ My monitor is a SAMSUNG wide curved gaming monitor. It isn't sold anymore, but I'd buy another SAMSUNG monitor in a hot second.  

‚å®Ô∏è Currently obsessed with [MX Keys by Logitech - MASTER Series](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/keyboards/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard.920-009295.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAjoeRBhAJEiwAYY3nDL25ZNH0XoBu_8Cg3Z4KWbR_dbD2Qg_wtEgQtbHVGAvMO9MURW4_choCabgQAvD_BwE)  

üñ±Ô∏è I LOVE the Mac Magic Mouse, but I've since switched over to [MX Anywhere 3 Mouse by Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3-for-business.910-006204.html)  

üéß I'm using an old Bose Quiet Comfort set from a few years ago, which I'm looking to replace them soon with [SONY WH-1000XM4 headphones](https://www.sony.ca/en/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4). Mostly because I'm sick of my PC never auto-recognizing my headphones, and Mac overriding the bluetooth settings in my headphones!  

üîà I don't really use it as a speaker for music so much, but I love my [Google Nest Mini](https://store.google.com/ca/product/google_nest_mini?hl=en-GB). I mostly use it to control my lights and lazily add calendar items to my Google Calendar.  

üî¶ What hardware list would be complete without the cool coloured lights I have mounted on the back of my monitor? [Govee Flow Plus Smart LED Light Bars](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B096WZXKZP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  

ü™ë I use a shitty Ikea desk which needs to be replaced, badly. And I also use an architecht's chair which can be used as a high chair or a low chair.  


## VSCode Extensions ##
üñ±Ô∏è I develop using VSCode and it's various extensions.

I'm new to developing with Arduino, but I'm excited to get moving with more C++ knowledge.
